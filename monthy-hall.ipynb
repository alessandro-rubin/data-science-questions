    "In this notebook I study the monthy hall problem and the importance of the basis assumptions by doing numeric statistical simulations. The monthy hall problem is divided in three stages. In the first stage the contestant chooses (randomly) one of the three doors offered to him. After this, the presenter opens one of the remaining doors that he KNOWS contains a donkey. After this, the contestant is offered to keep his door or change it. The question is if the contestant should keep or change the door in order to maximize his winning chances. Also, we'll check if the assumption of the presenter knowing what is behind the doors really matters.\n",
